GoLimiter is a Go library designed to control the number of concurrently executing goroutines. This library provides a straightforward way to create a goroutine pool that limits the number of goroutines running at the same time, effectively managing resource use and preventing overload.

## Features

- Create a goroutine pool with a customizable concurrency limit.
- Easy-to-use API for submitting tasks.
- Ability to dynamically adjust the capacity of the goroutine pool.

## Installation

To start using GoLimiter, you need to install it into your Go project. You can do this with the following Go command:

```bash
go get github.com/Yewenyu/GoLimiter
```

Ensure that your Go version is at least 1.11, as GoLimiter uses modules for dependency management.

## Usage

Here is how you can use GoLimiter to manage concurrency in your Go applications:

1. **Import the package**:

   ```go
   import "github.com/Yewenyu/GoLimiter"
   ```

2. **Create a new goroutine pool**:

   ```go
   pool := golimiter.NewGoroutinePool[int](10, func(task int) {
       fmt.Println("Handling task", task)
   })
   ```

   This creates a new pool that can handle up to 10 tasks concurrently.

3. **Submit tasks to the pool**:

   ```go
   for i := 0; i < 50; i++ {
       pool.SubmitTask(i)
   }
   ```

   This submits 50 tasks to the pool, which are processed concurrently by up to 10 goroutines.
